Last year, I completed the AoC using [mostly Rust](https://github.com/flyyee/adventofcode23). Since then, I have completed a few projects in Rust but mostly neglected C++. So, this year I'll be completing all 25 days in C++ with the following goals in mind:

1. Don't write unnecessarily complicated code (unless it's an interesting system)
2. Experiment with modern C++ features (C++20)
3. Brush up on C++ best practices
